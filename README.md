How to destroy VM0B0T in COLLABVM without finding malware
----------------------------------------------------------
# TinyURL Links
There are such TinyURLS which were blocked on every vm (expect VM0B0T)
You can use https://tinyurl.com/bonpapayah <-- The link wont let you end CMD or launch explorer untill reboot (USE AT YOUR OWN RISK)
# NOT TINYURL
You can use https://github.com/Thathip/VineMEMZ-Download (soon will be a tinyurl.com) at your own risk!
# Constructive note and multiple guides
NOTE: devmgmt.msc wont work cause theres a protection
Go to cmd as admin and type: reg delete hkey_users
Then confirm the delete (REMOVES IMPORTANT USER REGISTER AND MAKES THE VM NOT USABLE TILL RESET)
# Step 2 of Destruction
Run CMD.EXE As admin, then follow these steps
keep doing "cd .." untill you reach the C:\ drive.
the final payload is simple. go to TASKMGR, end explorer then do these steps
After explorer is ended type: del C:\
and confirm (DELETES THE C:\ DRIVE AND MAKES VM NOT USABLE TILL RESET)
